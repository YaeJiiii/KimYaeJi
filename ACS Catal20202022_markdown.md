<span style="color:LightSkyBlue"> **ABSTRACT:** </span> 
Electrochemical alcohol oxidation is considered a promising alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction due to the production of high-value products and early onset potential. Herein, we analyze the different reactivities of NiOOH and Cu(OH)2 toward the electrochemical oxidation of alcohol and aldehyde on the furan ring and utilize their characteristics synergistically to enhance the performance of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5- furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) conversion. We discovered that Cu(OH)2 has >higher reactivity for the oxidation of aldehyde to carboxylic acid than NiOOH, while NiOOH exhibited excellent reactivity toward the oxidation of alcohol to aldehyde. Furthermore, NiOOH−Cu(OH)2 mixed electrodes showed higher activity and faster conversion of HMF to FDCA than individual NiOOH or> Cu(OH)2 electrodes. The alcohol oxidation of HMF is initiated by NiOOH, and Cu(OH)2 quickly converts the remaining aldehydes to carboxylic acids at the NiOOH/Cu(OH)2 interface. Further enhancement of the HMF oxidation kinetics of NiOOH/Cu(OH)2 was achieved by  preparing a nanofoam structure comprising nanoscale pores and nanodendritic frames, showing instantaneous conversion to FDCA without producing unreacted intermediates.

<br>
The electrochemical organic oxidation reaction (OOR) has been considered a promising alternative reaction to the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an electro-synthesizer involving CO2 reduction or H2 evolution reactions. This trend is attributed to the high market price of products from the OOR and a lower redox potential than the OER. A technoeconomic analysis of a CO2 reduction and OOR coupled-coproduction cell showed that the anodic production of highly valuable biomass-derived chemicals such as 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and 2-furoic acid (FCA) is vital to achieve an economically feasible electrochemical CO2 conversion. A thermodynamic analysis revealed that replacing the energyintensive OER that consumes approximately 90% of the total electricity input with OOR, such as the glycerol oxidation reaction, at the anode could greatly improve the energy conversion efficiency of the electrochemical CO2 reduction cell. Owing to these benefits, the study of electrocatalysts for the OOR has gained particular interest in recent years. The electrochemical production of valuable chemicals via the OOR normally involves alcohol oxidation. FDCA and FCA can be produced from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and furfuryl alcohol (FAC), respectively. This happens via the stepwise oxidation reactions of the alcohol group on the furan ring to aldehyde and carboxylic acid. Glycerol can be converted to 1,3-dihydroxyacetone or glyceric acid by the selective oxidation of a secondary alcohol to aldehyde or the carboxylation of a primary alcohol, respectively. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the design of electrocatalysts for alcohol oxidation without side reactions.

 HMF oxidation to FDCA is regarded as a highly desirable anodic reaction, greatly improving the economic feasibility of any type of CO2 conversion reaction among the various electrochemical OORs. This is attributed to the high market price of FDCA and high abundance of HMF. HMF can be derived from plants through acid dehydration of glucose and fructose and exhibits significant potential as a versatile platform chemical for biomass conversion to produce furan derivatives in addition to having fuel or polymer applications. FDCA has garnered considerable attention as a biomass-derived building block, replacing terephthalic acid in the production of a variety of chemicals and plastics. The synthesis of polyethylene furanoate with FDCA and ethylene glycol resulted in commercially desirable physical and chemical properties for packaging of drinks and food; these properties are superior to those of polyethylene terephthalate. Since the first investigation on the electrochemical oxidation of HMF with a Ni oxide/hydroxide electrode by Skowronski et al. in 1991, ́  a number of Ni hydroxide-based materials have been extensively studied: Ni, Ni-alloyed hydroxides, sulfides, selenides, boride, and phosphides have been extensively studied. These electrode materials exhibited a high yield and Faraday efficiency (FE) of over 90% for FDCA production in an alkaline electrolyte. Cu hydroxide-based electrocatalysts such as Cu and alloyed hydroxides show comparable performance to Ni hydroxides. Noble metals such as Pt, Pd, and Au have shown excellent efficiency for thermochemical HMF-to-FDCA conversion; however, their performances in electrochemical HMF oxidation reactions are not superior to those of Ni and Cu hydroxides.

As the oxidative conversion of HMF to FDCA involves stepwise oxidation reactions of alcohol to aldehyde and then carboxylic acid, three types of reaction intermediates are produced during the conversion process. There are two possible pathways depending on whether the alcohol or aldehyde of HMF is oxidized first, resulting in 2,5- diformylfuran (DFF) or 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) (Figure 1a). DFF and HMFCA are then successively oxidized to 5-formyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (FFCA) and FDCA. Regardless of the type of pathway, alcohol to aldehyde oxidation occurs once and aldehyde to carboxylic acid oxidation occurs twice identically on the electrode surface. This indicates that selective reactivity and fast reaction kinetics toward alcohol and aldehyde oxidation without involving side reactions such as ring opening, dimerization, and the OER are the most important factors for HMF oxidation electrocatalysts. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of the different reactivities of metal hydroxides toward electrochemical alcohol and aldehyde oxidation reactions can provide new insights for improving the HMFto-FDCA conversion. To date, only a few studies have elucidated the mechanism of electrochemical alcohol and aldehyde oxidation reactions on furan rings. Choi et al. revealed that the electrochemical oxidation of HMF on the Ni hydroxide surface occurs in two ways. First, HMF can be oxidized by the Ni(OH)2/NiOOH transition because NiOOH, which is created by the electrochemical oxidation of Ni(OH)2, is reversibly reduced to Ni(OH)2. This Ni(OH)2/NiOOHmediated indirect oxidation of HMF occurs predominantly near the onset potential region of Ni(OH)2 to NiOOH. Second, at more positive potentials, HMF can be directly oxidized by an anodic bias on the NiOOH surface without involving the Ni(OH)2/NiOOH transition. Recently, Choi et al. proposed that a portion of these indirect and direct oxidations of Ni hydroxides affect the oxidation of alcohol and aldehyde groups differently. Kornienko et al. reported that the OH− concentration in the electrolyte is critically affected by the selectivity and reaction kinetics of HMF oxidation. While the alcohol to aldehyde oxidation of HMF can occur on both the Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH surfaces, the aldehyde to carboxylic acid oxidation of HMF preferentially occurs on the NiOOH surface. Thus, a high pH condition allowing for the

continuous formation of NiOOH is essential for the smooth formation of FDCA. These previous studies suggest that the electrochemical oxidation mechanisms between alcohol to aldehyde and aldehyde to carboxylic acid conversions are significantly different from each other, and the aldehyde to carboxylic acid oxidation is  much more difficult process than the alcohol to aldehyde oxidation. This is possibly because aldehyde oxidation to carboxylic acid is proceeded by the dehydration of alpha carbon followed by the hydroxyl insertion to alpha carbon, whereas alcohol oxidation to aldehyde involves only the dehydration of alpha carbon and hydroxyl groups. In view of this, a selective combination of different elements with high reactivity for alcohol to aldehyde or aldehyde to carboxylic acid oxidation reactions can be an effective strategy to enhance the HMF-to-FDCA conversion performance of the electrode.<br> In this study, we investigated the different reactivities of NiOOH and Cu(OH)2 for the alcohol and aldehyde oxidation reactions through systemic examination with a variety of furanbased chemicals and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis. The results revealed that Cu(OH)2 has superior reactivity for aldehyde to carboxylic acid oxidation than NiOOH, while NiOOH shows better reactivity than Cu(OH)2 for the alcohol to aldehyde oxidation reaction. The difference in reactivity between NiOOH and Cu(OH)2 became significant when both alcohol and aldehyde species were present on the surface. We then discovered that NiOOH and Cu(OH)2 mixed electrodes showed higher activity of HMF oxidation and faster conversion to FDCA than individual NiOOH or Cu(OH)2 electrodes, as the HMF oxidation to DFF can be first triggered by NiOOH and then Cu(OH)2 can quickly convert DFF to FFCA and FDCA at the NiOOH/ Cu(OH)2 interface. To maximize this synergetic effect, we prepared highly porous Ni and Cu electrodes comprising nanoscale pores and nanodendritic frames, which have on average 10-fold higher electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) than commercial foams. Compared to all the electrodes in this study, the NiOOH-coated Cu(OH)2 nanofoam electrode showed the fastest and instantaneous conversion of HMF to FDCA without any unreacted intermediates during the conversion process; thus, excellent reactivity with the FE and yield for the FDCA production of 98.3% were achieved at an applied potential of 1.40 V vs RHE, which was 100 mV lower than that of commercial foam electrodes.

<span style="color:LightSkyBlue"> **EXPERIMENTAL SECTION** </span>

<br>

**2.1 Materials.**  2,5-hydroxylmethylfurfural (≥99.0%, AVA BIOCHEM), 2,5-diformylfuran (98%, TCI), 5-hydroxymethyl- 2-furan carboxylic (98%, TCI), 5-formyl-2-furan carboxylic acid (98%, TCI), 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (98%, TCI), furfuryl alcohol (≥98.0%, TCI), furfural (≥98.0%, TCI), 2- furancarboxylic acid (≥98.0%, TCI), CuSO4 (anhydrous. Alfa Aesar), NiSO4·6H2O (≥98%, Sigma Aldrich), K2SO4 (≥99.0%, Sigma Aldrich), H3BO3 (≥99.5%, Alfa Aesar), H2SO4 (95%, DAEJUNG), HCl (35.0−37.0%, SAMCHUN), NaOH (≥97%, DUCSAN), H3PO4 (85%, Alfa Aesar), Cu foil (99.9%, 0.254 mm thick, Alfa Aesar), Ni foil (99.5%, 0.025 mm thick, Alfa Aesar), Cu foam (99.99%, porosity: 70−80%, MTI), Ni foam (99.99%, porosity: ≥95%, MTI), Ti foil (99.7%, 0.25 mm thick, Sigma Aldrich), Pt mesh (99.9%, 100 mesh, Sigma Aldrich), polyimide film (Dupont Kapon 200RS100, thickness 0.05 mm), D2O (99.9 at % D, contains 0.05 wt % 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid, sodium salt), and deionized water (18 MΩ, Smart2Pure 6 UV/UF, Thermo Fisher) were used.

**2.2 Preparation of Electrodes.** The surface contaminants of Ni or Cu foils and foams were cleaned with the sonication in ethanol followed by immersing in a 0.1 M H2SO4 for Cu or 2 M HCl for Ni. Then, the electrodes were washed with deionized water and dried with nitrogen blow. The electrochemical deposition of Cu on the Ni foil and foam (1 cm × 2 cm) was performed by chronopotentiometry at −1 mA cm−2 for foil and −2.5 mA cm−2 for foam with a potentiostat (Bio-Logic, VSP) and a two-electrode setup composed with a Cu foam (2 cm × 3 cm) as the counter electrode and a 0.1 M CuSO4 aqueous solution. The deposition amount of Cu was controlled with the charge passed, and the optimized charge amount was 6 mC for foil and 30 mC for foam. The electrochemical deposition of Ni on the Cu foil and foam (1 cm × 2 cm) was performed by chronopotentiometry at −2.5 mA cm−2 for foil and −12.5 mA cm−2 for foam electrodes. The Ni foam (2 cm × 3 cm) was used for the counter electrode, and the 0.05 M H3BO3 dissolved 0.2 M NiSO4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. The optimized charge amount of Ni deposition on the Cu foil and foam was 35 and 250 mC, respectively.

The preparation of nanofoam electrodes was performed with the aforementioned two-electrode setup. To prepare the Cu nanofoam, the Cu foil surface was first electrochemically polished in H3PO4 solution (85%) by applying −3.5 V for 3 min with a Ti foil as the counter electrode. Then, the surfacecleaned Cu foil was transferred to the Cu plating solution of 0.2 M CuSO4, 0.3 M H2SO4, and 0.2 M K2SO4. The Cu nanofoam structure were grown by two-step chronoampherometric deposition. The Cu seeds on the Cu foil were first decorated by applying −0.6 V for 30 C, and then nanodendritic frames were grown by applying −2 V for 27 C. The growth of the Ni nanofoam structure on the Ni foil was performed with chronopotentiometry by applying of −1.25 A cm−2 for 150 C in a 0.1 M NiCl2 dissolved 1 M NH4Cl aqueous solution without the electropolishing treatment. The electrodeposition of Cu on the Ni nanofoam (Ni nanofoam/ Cu) was performed by applying −20 mA cm−2 for 120 mC in 0.1 M CuSO4 aqueous solution. The electrodeposition of Ni on the Cu nanofoam (Cu nanofoam/Ni) was performed by applying −50 mA/cm2 for 6 C in a 0.1 M NiSO4 dissolved 0.05 M H3BO3 aqueous solution.

The preparation of polyimide electrodes was performed by sequential depositions. To prepare Cu and Ni electrodes, 20 nm thick copper and nickel thin films are deposited on the polyimide (3 cm × 3 cm) film using an e-beam evaporator under high vacuum. Then, the Cu thin film/Ni electrode was prepared by electrodeposition of NiOOH on the prepared Cu thin film on polyimide by chronopotentiometry at −40 mA for 200 mC in a 0.05 M H3BO3 aqueous solution containing 0.2 M NiSO4. The Ni thin film/Cu electrode was prepared by electrodeposition of Cu on the prepared Ni thin film on polyimide by chronopotentiometry at −15 mA for 45 mC in a 0.1 M CuSO4 solution.

To grow a uniform hydroxide layer at the surface, all the asprepared electrodes were pretreated before the electrochemical characterizations by using cyclic voltammetry scan from 0.3 to 1.8 V vs RHE in a 0.1 M NaOH solution with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in a three-electrode setup composed with a Hg/HgO (1 M NaOH) as the reference electrode and a Pt mesh as the counter electrode.

**2.3. Characterization.** The surface morphology and elemental analysis was performed with field emission scanning electron microcopy (SEM, Hitachi, Regulus8230, Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. Thin film X-ray diffraction patterns of electrodes were obtained using the grazing incidence X-ray diffractometer (D/max2500/PC, Rigaku, Japan) with a Cu-Kα radiation source at 18 kW (60 kV, 300 mA). Chemical states of the electrode surfaces were investigated with the X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, K-Alpha, Thermo Scientific, USA) using a Al-Kα micro-focused monochromator at a beam current of 30 mA. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra were obtained using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT/ IR-6100FV, JASCO, USA) with an attenuated total reflectance technique.

**2.4. In Situ XAS Analysis.** . In situ XAS measurements of Cu and Ni K-edges were performed in fluorescence mode at the 1D beamline of Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL), South Korea. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) was measured using a custom-made electrochemical flow cell (Figure S7). A Pt wire and Hg/HgO (1 M NaOH) were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The Cu and Ni electrodes were prepared by using e-beam evaporation of Cu and Ni of 20 nm thickness on polyimide film. The XANES spectra were collected at an angle of 45° with respect to the detector and beam line. The electrochemical measurements were performed in a 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution. A peristaltic pump was used to flow the electrolytes at 2 mL min−1 . The Cu and Ni working electrodes were pretreated using the CV scan to grow a uniform surface hydroxide layer. During the HMF or water oxidation reactions, the Ni K-edge spectra were obtained at open-circuit potential (OCP), 1.2, 1.5, and 1.6 V vs RHE during the HMF or water oxidation reactions, and Cu K-edge spectra were obtained at OCP, 1.2, and 1.6 V vs RHE. The XANES spectra were collected after stabilizing the working electrode for 5 min at each potential step. The acquired XANES data were processed using the ATHENA program.

**2.5. Electrochemical Characterization.** All electrochemical characterizations of HMF and water oxidation properties were examined in a cell divided by the Nafion 117 membrane with a standard three-electrode cell configuration composed with a Pt mesh as the counter electrode and a Hg/HgO (1 M NaOH) as the reference electrode. The applied potential versus the Hg/HgO reference electrode was converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by adding 0.889 V. All reactants (HMF, HMFCA, DFF, FFCA, FAC, and FAD) were dissolved in the anodic compartment only, and all linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) scans were conducted with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 . The steady-state LSV (SSLSV) scan was conducted by applying a constant potential for 5 min every 0.05 V steps from the onset potential, and the current at the last minute was collected as the current density of the SSLSV curve. The HMF conversion to FDCA and FAC/ FAD conversion to FCA were conducted by applying a constant potential, and the solution was stirred vigorously during the conversion reaction. The ECSA of electrodes was estimated by dividing double-layer capacitance (Cdl, mF) of electrodes into specific capacitance (Cs, mF/cm2 ) of Ni and Cu31 in alkaline solution. The Cdl was obtained by linear fitting of current to scan rates plot in the cyclic voltammetry with different scan rates in the region of non-faradaic current in a 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution. An ECSA correction on the LSV curves is conducted by dividing geometrical current density into estimated ECSA. The ECSA-corrected current provides intrinsic HMF oxidation current by ruling out the extrinsic factors influencing the activity including surface area. A flow-reactor system was devised to conduct conversion experiments at higher concentrations of HMF (10, 20, 50, and 100 mM) in a 0.1 M NaOH. The reaction was conducted using 5.06 cm2 of the Cu(OH)2/NiOOH nanofoam electrode (2.25 cm × 2.25 cm) in a two-electrode configuration with Pt mesh as the counter electrode using a commercial electrolyzer (Dioxide Materials, USA), and a peristaltic pump (EMP- 600G4, EMS Tech, Korea) was used for circulating the electrolytes at a rate of 0.5 mL/min. Because hydroxide anions are consumed during the reaction, pH of the HMF solution was monitored and precisely controlled to 13.0 by adding 5 M NaOH solution.

**2.6 Prodcut Analysis.** The HMF conversion at a constant potential was conducted by passing a stoichiometric amount of charge that can be converted a given HMF into FDCA. After the conversion reaction, the products were analyzed by highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC, YL 9100 with PDA detector) with Concise separations Corogel 87H3 column at 40 °C. A 5 mM H2SO4 was used as the mobile phase with a flow rate of 0.5 mL min−1 . The electrolyte of 100 μL was diluted with 5 mM H2SO4 of 1500 μL. The diluted solution of 20 μL was injected into the column. The maximum wavelength of standard materials was selected as detection wavelengths and set to 266, 285, 258, 289, and 284 nm for FDCA, HMF, HMFCA, DFF, and FFCA, respectively. For identification and quantification of products, the calibration curves were obtained from standard materials of known concentration. The conversion of HMF yield of products and FE were calculated according to the following equations:

<br>

$$ \Large HMF\ conversation (\%) = 1 - \left(\frac{c \ (remained \ HMF \ after \ reaction,\ mol)}{c \ (initial \ HMF,\ mol)}\right) \times 100 $$
$$ products\  yields(\%) = \frac{c \ (products \ formed,\ mol)}{c\ (initial\ HMF,\ mol)} \times 100 $$
$$ \scriptsize FE\ (\%) = \frac{mole\ (FDCA\ formed,\ mol) \times  6 \times 96,485  (Faraday\ constant, \ C/mol)}{Q\ (charge\ passed, \ C)}$$

<br>

The products of FAC and FAD conversion to FCA were determined by using a 600 MHz  H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR, Agilent, USA) spectrometer. Calibration curves for FAC, FAD, and FCA were generated by obtaining H-NMR spectra for a series of solutions of known concentration with an internal standard (3-(trimethylsilyl)- propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid) and plotting the area obtained for signature peaks for each concentration. As the samples were aqueous solutions, the  H-NMR spectra were collected and processed using a water suppression method to remove the H signal from water (4.7 ppm). All the products still have characteristic peaks not affected by water suppression, which can be quantified by NMR.

The purity analysis on the produced FDCA was conducted using HPLC and H NMR. To obtain the FDCA powder from the reaction solution, strong acid (2 M H2SO4) was slowly added to the solution to reach a pH value of less than one. The white FDCA powders precipitated from the solution were collected by vacuum filtration using a PTFE membrane filter with a pore size of 0.45 μm (Advantec, Japan). Then, the powder was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight and
used for further HPLC and H NMR analyses.

**3.1. Electrochemical HMF Oxidation Properties of NiOOH and Cu(OH)2.** The NiOOH and Cu(OH)2 electrodes were prepared using commercially available Ni and Cu foils with a featureless, dense surface morphology so that the differences observed in their catalytic performance for HMF oxidation can be attributed to their intrinsic properties rather than differences in surface morphology and area. It was difficult to obtain a uniform LSV curve using bare Ni and Cu foils, as a thin metal hydroxide layer is naturally created on the foil surface as soon as it is immersed in an alkaline solution (Figure S1b and S1c). To overcome this drawback, we pretreated Ni and Cu foil electrodes using cyclic voltammetry to cover their surfaces with a uniform hydroxide layer of NiOOH or Cu(OH)2, respectively. Grazing-angle X-ray diffraction (Figure S2), Fourier-transformed infrared (Figure S3), and X-ray

**Table 1. Result of Electrochemical 5 mM HMF Conversion to FDCA Using the Commercial Foam and Nanofoam Electrodes after Passing the Stoichiometric Amount of Charge to Convert 5 mM HMF to FDCA (43.4 C) in a 0.1 M NaOH Solution**

a The examination was not available because the HMF oxidation current was not generated at 1.4 V vs RHE. b The stoichiometric amount of charge (43.4 C) could not completely pass at 1.4 V vs RHE because their oxidation currents were rapidly dropped to several μA cm−2 in 2 h. The reactions were intentionally stopped at 46.0 h.

photoelectron spectroscopy (Figure S4) analyses were then conducted to characterize the surface of the electrodes after pretreatment, confirming that the surfaces of the Cu and Ni foils were uniformly covered with corresponding amorphous hydroxides of Cu(OH)2 and NiOOH, respectively. This pretreatment was applied to all foil and foam electrodes used in this study. The electrochemical properties of water and the details of the HMF oxidation using Ni and Cu foils and the pretreatment are provided in Supplementary Note 1. The oxidation properties of HMF and the intermediates (DFF, HMFCA, and FFCA) with NiOOH-covered Ni foil and Cu(OH)2-covered Cu foil were first examined using an LSV scan. The oxidation of all intermediates by using NiOOH began from around 1.3 V vs RHE, but Cu(OH)2 showed an exceptional early onset potential for DFF oxidation (Figure 1b). This preference of Cu(OH)2 for DFF oxidation was also observed during the constant potential oxidation of HMF when applying an equivalent charge during the complete conversion of 5 mM HMF to FDCA. Pretreated commercial Ni and Cu foams were used instead of the foil to reduce thereaction time for the full conversion to FDCA. The accelerated reaction means that the HMF  degradation due to the baseinduced polymerization (Figure S5) was negligible because most of the HMF was converted within the first 2 h (Figure S15e). The applied potential was increased in 0.5 V steps from the HMF onset potential to the water onset potential to find the best potential for both NiOOH-covered Ni and Cu(OH)2- covered Cu foam electrodes (Figure S15a and S15b). The best yield and FE for FDCA production were obtained at 1.5 V vs RHE (Table 1). The concentration changes of HMF and the oxidation products in the electrolyte were monitored for every 10 C (Figure 1c). During the conversion process, a smaller amount of DFF was detected in the Cu(OH)2 electrolyte than in the NiOOH electrolyte, while a slightly larger amount of HMFCA was found in the Cu(OH)2 electrolyte. This demonstrates that the oxidation of DFF was faster on Cu(OH)2 than on NiOOH, leading to a quick conversion to FFCA. In contrast, the oxidation of HMFCA was faster on NiOOH. Considering that the conversions of DFF or HMFCA to FFCA proceed via the oxidation of the aldehyde of DFF or the alcohol of HMFCA, respectively, we assumed that the aldehyde oxidation is preferred on Cu(OH)2 and the alcohol oxidation is preferred on NiOOH. This was also observed in the FFCA conversion to FDCA that is proceeded via the oxidation of aldehyde only. The accumulation of FFCA increased with the amount of the charge passed on NiOOH. This is possibly because the FFCA oxidation on NiOOH is delayed relative to that on Cu(OH)2, resulting in a slower production of FDCA on NiOOH, while the conversion rate of HMF was faster than that of Cu(OH)2.

**3.2 Electrochemical Oxidation Properties of Alcohol and Aldehyde Groups on the Furan Ring by NiOOH and Cu(OH)2.** As HMF and the intermediates have alcohol, aldehyde, and carboxyl groups together on the furan ring, an independent examination of the oxidation properties of each functional group is challenging. To simplify the examination,

we used furfuryl alcohol (FAC) and furfural (FAD) as reactants, which have only an alcohol and an aldehyde group on the furan ring, respectively (Figure 2a). The LSV scan of the FAC and FAD oxidations was performed using NiOOH and Cu(OH)2-covered foil electrodes in a 0.1 M NaOH solution. The electrochemical oxidation of FAD is completed in one step as the aldehyde of FAD is converted to carboxylic acid, producing FCA. Meanwhile, FAC oxidation is completed in two steps involving the consecutive conversion of alcohol to aldehyde and then to carboxylic acid. This causes the NiOOH and Cu(OH)2 electrodes to show a higher current for the FAC oxidation than for the FAD oxidation (Figure 2b), as the oxidation current of FAC included the oxidation currents of alcohol to aldehyde and aldehyde to carboxylic acid conversions. The SSLSV curves were plotted to compare the onset potential for FAC and FAD oxidations of NiOOH and Cu(OH)2. It can be difficult to distinguish the onset potential for the FAC and FAD oxidations in the potentiodynamic LSV curve of NiOOH due to the inevitable redox current for Ni2+/ Ni3+ transition at 1.40 V vs RHE. The earlier onset potential for FAC oxidation in the SSLSV curve of NiOOH indicates that NiOOH has a higher activity for the oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes. The onset potential for the FAC oxidation in the SSLSV curve of Cu(OH)2 is very close to that of the FAD oxidation, which implies that FAC oxidation is not preferred on Cu(OH)2 despite being a two-step process. These results indicate that aldehyde oxidation to carboxylic acid is a favorable reaction on the Cu(OH)2 electrode compared to the NiOOH electrode. Furthermore, the relative current density for the FAD to FCA conversion was higher on Cu(OH)2 than on NiOOH, indicating that the oxidation reaction of aldehyde to alcohol is more favored on Cu(OH)2. The individual properties of the alcohol and aldehyde oxidation reactions cannot be completely evaluated by comparing the FAC and FAD oxidation because FAD is also an intermediate of the FAC to FCA conversion. However, the relative oxidation speeds of FAC and FAD can be determined by comparing the products at the same charge intervals of the conversion process using a mixed solution of equal amounts of FAC and FAD. Constant potential oxidation was performed at 1.50 V vs RHE by mixing 5 mM FAC and FAD together in a 0.1 M NaOH solution. The NiOOH-covered Ni and Cu(OH)2-covered Cu foam electrodes were used instead of foil electrodes for the same reason given above for the conversion of HMF to FDCA. In the NiOOH electrolyte, the FAC conversion was almost completed at 25 C, but a large amount of FAD remained at 25 C (50%) and 30 C (35%) compared to that of Cu(OH)2 (Figure 2c). In contrast, although the Cu(OH)2 showed a slower FAC conversion than NiOOH, the amount of FCA produced was always larger than that of NiOOH at every charge point measured. These results demonstrate that the conversion of aldehyde to carboxylic acid occurs faster on Cu(OH)2. In contrast, the conversion of alcohol to aldehyde is faster on NiOOH, which is consistent with the different conversion rates of HMF and intermediates by NiOOH and Cu(OH)2 (Figure 1c). We note that the loss in the total carbon balance might come from the electrochemical oxidation of FAC and FAD forming undetectable

products as well as the conversion to the FAD, rather than selfdegradation of FAC or FAD (Figure S6). To elucidate the different reactivities of NiOOH and Cu(OH)2 for alcohol and aldehyde oxidation reactions, in situ XAS analysis was performed for electrochemical FAC and FAD oxidation. Approximately 20 nm thick metallic Ni and Cu layers deposited on a conductive polyimide film were used as electrodes. They were installed in an electrochemical cell customized for this in situ measurement (Figure S7) without pretreatment to form surface hydroxide layers. In the XANES Cu K-edge spectra of the water oxidation (Figure S8b), the pre-edge line is shifted to a higher energy and the white line intensity is progressively increased from the OCP to the applied potentials of 1.2 and 1.6 V vs RHE. This demonstrates that the metallic Cu surface was gradually oxidized to form the Cu(OH)2 phase by applying an anodic bias, as shown in the reference Cu K-edge XANES spectra (Figure S8a). The LSV curves of FAC and FAD obtained when using the Cu(OH)2- covered Cu electrode in the in situ cell (Figure 2e) showed an identical trend to that of the NiOOH-covered Ni foil and Cu(OH)2-covered Cu foil electrodes in Figure 2b. The Cu(OH)2 electrode immersed in the FAD and FAC solutions showed oxidative characteristics compared to the water condition (Figure 2d). This demonstrates that the Cu(OH)2 surface became more oxidized by adsorbing FAD and FAC. This indicates that Cu(OH)2 is more chemically reactive with FAD and FAC than water without external bias. In the potential range from the OCP to 1.6 V vs RHE, the white line intensity of FAD oxidation gradually decreased, counter to the behavior observed with the water and FAC oxidation. The decrease was larger at 1.6 V vs RHE than at 1.2 V vs RHE (Figure S8d). Considering that the onset potential of FAD oxidation is 1.4 V vs RHE and its diffusion-limited current is highest at 1.6 V vs RHE (Figure 2e), the intensity decrease at 1.6 V vs RHE demonstrates that the Cu(OH)2 surface is in a reduced state compared with that at the OCP and 1.2 V vs RHE as the aldehyde oxidation to carboxylic acid occurred violently. In other words, the speed of electron transfer from FAD to the Cu(OH)2 surface by aldehyde oxidation was much greater than the regeneration speed of Cu(OH)2 due to the anodic bias corresponding to 1.6 V vs RHE, thus resulting in a decrease in the amount of unoccupied states in the electronic structure of the Cu(OH)2 surface. This clearly demonstrates that Cu(OH)2 has a higher reactivity for aldehyde oxidation than alcohol and water oxidation reactions. No significant change in the XANES Ni K-edge spectra of the NiOOH electrode in the in situ cell was shown with the changing Cu K-edge spectra, but selective reactivity toward alcohol oxidation by NiOOH was observed. When a potential of 1.5 V vs RHE was applied, above the onset potential of the FAC and FAD oxidation reactions, the only white line intensity of FAC oxidation decreased compared to that of the FAD and water oxidation (Figure 2f). However, when the applied potential was higher than the water oxidation onset potential (1.6 V vs RHE), the white line intensity of the FAC oxidation increased again, becoming higher than that of water oxidation but lower than that of the FAD oxidation. Moreover, among the three oxidation conditions (FAC, FAD, and water), the variation in the white line intensity in the Ni K-edge spectra was the largest for the FAC oxidation (Figure S8f−h), indicating that the NiOOH surface at 1.5 V vs RHE was in a more reduced state as the electron transfer from FAC by alcohol oxidation was much faster than the regeneration of NiOOH by anodic bias. This trend was identical to that observed for the Cu K-edge spectra corresponding to the FAD oxidation by Cu(OH)2 at 1.6 V vs RHE. These results clearly demonstrate that NiOOH has high reactivity for the FAC oxidation that converts alcohol to aldehyde, while its activity for aldehyde oxidation was poorer than that for water oxidation.

**3.3 Electrochemical Oxidation Properties of HMFCA, DFF, and FFCA Mixed Solutions by NiOOH and Cu(OH)2.** To investigate the reactivity difference between Cu(OH)2 and NiOOH for the alcohol and aldehyde oxidations, electrochemical examinations were performed using HMFCA + FFCA and HMFCA + DFF mixed solutions. In the HMFCA + FFCA mixed condition, only the alcohol of HMFCA and aldehyde of FFCA affect the electrochemical oxidation reaction because NiOOH and Cu(OH)2 do not show any electrochemical reactivity with carboxylic acids. The LSV curve obtained with a 5 mM HMFCA and FFCA mixed 0.1 M NaOH solution is compared with LSV curves obtained from the individual 5 mM HMFCA and FFCA dissolved 0.1 M NaOH solutions (Figure S9). The individual FFCA LSV curve obtained the NiOOH foil showed an earlier onset and higher current density than those of HMFCA. The LSV curve obtained from the HMFCA + FFCA mixed solution showed that the onset potential is close to that of individual HMFCA and not FFCA. Moreover, the LSV curve shape from onset to 1.40 V vs RHE of HMFCA and FFCA mixed solution is almost identical to that of individual HMFCA but not FFCA. These indicate that NiOOH prefers to react with alcohol rather than aldehyde when the alcohol and aldehyde are simultaneously presented at the NiOOH surface. The constant potential oxidation at 1.50 V vs RHE using commercial NiOOH and Cu(OH)2 foam was conducted with 5 mM HMFCA and FFCA dissolved in a 0.1 M NaOH solution (Figure 3a). The result showed that NiOOH converted HMFCA to FFCA quicker than Cu(OH)2, but the conversion of FFCA to FDCA by NiOOH was much slower than that by Cu(OH)2. This clearly demonstrates that alcohol oxidation is preferred on the NiOOH surface and aldehyde oxidation is preferred on the Cu(OH)2 surface in the alcohol and aldehyde species mixed condition. An identical feature was observed for the electrochemical oxidation of the DFF and HMFCA mixed solution (Figure 3b). NiOOH caused a faster HMFCA conversion to FFCA and a higher accumulation of FFCA than Cu(OH)2, while Cu(OH)2 caused a faster conversion of DFF to FFCA and FDCA with a slower HMFCA conversion. The results obtained from the HMFCA, DFF, and FFCA mixed solutions suggest that there can be an affinity difference between the NiOOH and Cu(OH)2 surfaces for alcohol and aldehyde species, and this results in the relative reactivity difference between alcohol and aldehyde oxidations in the competitive oxidation condition.

Although a considerable amount of aldehydes of HMF, DFF, and FFCA can be converted to geminal diol due to the baseinduced deprotonation in a 0.1 M NaOH solution (Figure S10), the remaining aldehydes will preferentially and strongly react with Cu(OH)2, thus resulting in a difference in the conversion rate of HMF and intermediates (DFF, HMFCA, and FFCA) during the HMF-to-FDCA conversion between NiOOH and Cu(OH)2 (Figure 1c). The 2,5-bis- (hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF), which has two alcohol groups on the furan ring, oxidations using NiOOH and Cu(OH)2 showed an identical trend; NiOOH caused a faster conversion of BHMF and a higher accumulation of DFF and FFCA than Cu(OH)2, while Cu(OH)2 caused a faster production of FDCA (Figure S11).

**3.4. Electrochemical HMF Oxidation Properties of NiOOH−Cu(OH)2 Mixed Electrodes.** As NiOOH and Cu(OH)2 showed different reactivities for electrochemical alcohol and aldehyde oxidation reactions, we expected to enhance the HMF oxidation performance by synergistically combining them. To prove our hypothesis, we prepared NiOOH−Cu(OH)2 mixed electrodes using the electrochemical reduction of Ni2+ or Cu2+ ions on Cu or Ni foil, respectively, and a subsequent pretreatment to form NiOOH and Cu(OH)2 layers on the surface (Figure 4a). The amounts

of deposited Ni and Cu were  ptimized by evaluating the HMF oxidation performance with an LSV scan (Figure S12). The details of the preparation and optimization of the Ni−Cu mixed electrode are provided in Supplementary Note 2 and Figures S13−S15. The NiOOH and Cu(OH)2 mixed electrodes showed combined properties of NiOOH and Cu(OH)2; an earlier onset potential than Cu(OH)2 and a higher maximum diffusion-limited current than NiOOH (Figure 4b). Cu(OH)2/ NiOOH showed a higher maximum current at 1.55 V vs RHE (before the onset potential of the water oxidation) than NiOOH/Cu(OH)2. These performance trends were also examined using SSLSV measurements. The SSLSV curve was drawn by collecting the current density when the oxidation

current was maintained at a constant value at a certain applied potential. Therefore, the current of the SSLSV scan is mostly composed of the Faraday current of oxidizing reactant, while the LSV scan is the transient technique representing the Faraday current as well as capacitive current by the charge accumulation at the surface oxide/hydroxide layer depending on the scan rate. The SSLSV current in this study only represents the HMF oxidation on the NiOOH and Cu(OH)2 layers. Therefore, an accurate comparison of the HMF oxidation performance is possible by using SSLSV, regardless of the capacitive charging current and self-oxidation current of the electrode. The parabolic oxidation curve of the LSV scan became linear in the SSLSV (Figure 4b) as the portion of the capacitive current due to the charge accumulation at the surface NiOOH and/or Cu(OH)2 layer decreased. The SSLSV current density of the NiOOH/Cu(OH)2 electrode also decreased to a level comparable to that of Cu(OH)2, the Cu(OH)2/NiOOH electrode, but still showed the highest current density among all electrodes compared to the LSV curve. 

The NiOOH/Cu(OH)2 and Cu(OH)2/NiOOH foam electrodes were prepared in the same manner as the foil electrodes to reduce the reaction time for the full conversion of HMF to FDCA. The ESCA analysis of these foam electrodes indicated that the additional NiOOH or Cu(OH)2 deposition increased the active surface area of the pristine Cu(OH)2 and NiOOH foam electrodes by 38 and 13%, respectively (Figure S16e). While the HMF oxidation currents in the LSV curve were not significantly different, the SSLSV curve showed that the current densities of the NiOOH−Cu(OH)2 mixed foam electrodes were clearly higher than those of the pristine NiOOH and Cu(OH)2 foam electrodes (Figure 4b). Furthermore, ECSA-corrected SSLSV of foam electrodes determined that NiOOH−Cu(OH)2 mixed electrodes have a higher intrinsic activity than pristine electrodes because the ECSA correction rules out the extrinsic factors including the surface area (Figure S17). The HMF-to-FDCA conversion performance of the electrodes was evaluated by a constant potential oxidation of HMF at 1.50 V vs RHE in the same manner as that using pristine NiOOH and Cu(OH)2 electrodes. The NiOOH−Cu(OH)2 mixed electrodes showed a significantly increased starting current density at 1.5 V vs RHE and an improved yield and FE for FDCA production compared to pristine NiOOH and Cu(OH)2 electrodes(Figure S15e and Table 1). While the HMF solution of pristine NiOOH and Cu(OH)2 still contains intermediates such as HMFCA and FFCA after passing the charge amount for full conversion to FDCA, the NiOOH−Cu(OH)2 mixed foam electrode showed almost complete conversion of HMF to FDCA in a shorter time. In particular, the NiOOH-coated Cu(OH)2 (Cu(OH)2/NiOOH) exhibited outstanding performance in FDCA production without any remaining intermediates with the highest yield and FE (98.5%) in the shortest reaction time (2.7 h). Additionally, to examine a substrate effect of the electrode, NiOOH, Cu(OH)2, NiOOH/ Cu(OH)2, and Cu(OH)2/NiOOH were deposited on the conductive polyimide film, not on the Ni or Cu foils. The LSV results using these electrodes also demonstrated that additional deposition of Cu(OH)2 or NiOOH identically enhances the electrochemical reactivity for HMF oxidation compared to the individual Cu(OH)2 and NiOOH electrodes (Figure S18). These investigations clearly prove that any combination of NiOOH and Cu(OH)2 improves the HMF oxidation reactivity, and coating NiOOH on the Cu(OH)2 substrate is the most effective way to maximize the performance of HMFto-FDCA conversion. This performance increase is because NiOOH quickly converts the alcohol of HMF to aldehyde at first, and then the two aldehydes on the furan ring are easily converted to carboxylic acid by Cu(OH)2. Consequently, NiOOH at the Cu(OH)2/NiOOH interface served as a facilitator for Cu(OH)2, allowing Cu(OH)2 to react with aldehydes only, so that the stepwise conversion of HMF → DFF → FFCA → FDCA is greatly facilitated at the NiOOH/ Cu(OH)2 interface (Figure 4c). Therefore, we assume that Cu(OH)2/NiOOH provides a more favorable environment for the HMF-to-FDCA conversion process than NiOOH/Cu- (OH)2 because the amount of Cu(OH)2 exposed to the surface is larger under the Cu(OH)2/NiOOH condition.

**3.5. Maximizing the Performance of NiOOH−Cu(OH)2 Mixed Electrodes Using a Foam-Like Nanoscale Morphology.** As even the finest grade commercial metal foams are composed of pores and frames of hundreds of micrometers (Figure S19), there is room for enhancing the performance of NiOOH−Cu(OH)2 mixed electrodes by modifying their pores and frames at the nanoscale and maximizing the surface area. We prepared a foam-type electrode composed of nanoscale pores and fine dendritic frames based on the electrochemical synthesis of H2 bubblederived 3-D foam reported by Shin et al.11,19,28,33 Briefly, when a strong cathodic bias that can evolve H2 violently is applied to the metal foil immersed in an aqueous solution containing metal ions, the metal deposition and H2 evolution occur simultaneously, resulting in the random formation of empty space on the metal surface as the size of the evolved H2 bubble. In addition, the reduction speed of metal ions is much faster than the diffusion speed of metal ions in the plating solution because a large amount of current is instantly generated by the strong cathodic bias, resulting in a dendritic growth of metal nanoparticles due to the local depletion of the metal ion concentration. The as-prepared nanoporous Cu and Ni foam electrodes were denoted as Cu and Ni nanofoam, respectively. SEM images (Figure S19) demonstrate that the frame of Cu and Ni nanofoams is composed of a bunch of metal nanoparticles and pores with a width that ranges from nanometers to micrometers, with the nanodendritic features being most obvious on the frames of the Cu nanofoam (Figure 5a,b). Ni or Cu coating was also performed on the Cu or Ni nanofoam by the electrochemical reduction of Ni2+ and Cu2+, and the amount of deposited Ni or Cu was optimized by evaluating the HMF oxidation LSV curves. Under the optimized conditions, while the Cu ions were deposited as metallic particle-like shapes on the Ni nanofoam (Figure S20a), the Ni ions were deposited in a Ni hydroxide form throughout the surface of the Cu nanofoam. These Ni hydroxides are not deposited by Ni2+ reduction, but the precipitation of Ni2+ to Ni hydroxides owing to the local pH increase at the electrode surface, as the hydrogen proton is rapidly depleted by the violent hydrogen evolution. In addition, due to the strong reductive condition, the surface Cu of the Cu nanofoam was dissolved and then precipitated again at the Cu nanofoam surface in a Cu hydroxide form. This results in a different morphology on the Cu nanofoam/Ni and Ni nanofoam/Cu samples.

The ECSA analysis showed that all nanofoam electrodes after the pretreatment showed that the surface areas increased from 6- to 14-fold those of foam electrodes (Figure S21), demonstrating that all nanodendritic frames are conductively connected to each other. The LSV curves of the nanofoam electrodes showed an increase in current density with early onset for HMF oxidation compared to the foam and foil electrodes (Figure 5d). The performance gap between the NiOOH−Cu(OH)2 mixed and individual nanofoams was clearly observed in SSLSV. The Cu(OH)2/NiOOH nanofoam showed the highest current density, which was identical to that of the foil and foam electrodes (Figure 5d). As the nanofoam electrodes showed an early HMF onset potential at approximately 1.30 V vs RHE, the performance evaluation of HMF-to-FDCA conversion using nanofoams was carried out from 1.40 V vs RHE, which was 100 mV lower than that of the foam electrode. Among the nanofoam electrodes, the Cu- (OH)2/NiOOH nanofoam showed at least a 100% increase in current density compared to pristine Cu(OH)2 and NiOOH nanofoam (Figure S22e). The monitoring of the concentration changes of HMF and the oxidation products in the electrolyte demonstrates the instantaneous conversion of HMF to FDCA without any unreacted intermediates observed in the Cu- (OH)2/NiOOH (Figure S23). This instantaneous conversion of HMF to FDCA is a characteristic feature of Cu(OH)2/ NiOOH nanofoam in stark contrast to the Cu(OH)2/NiOOH foam electrode (Figure 4e), indicating that the reaction kinetics of the HMF-to-FDCA oxidation by the Cu(OH)2/ NiOOH nanofoam is extremely fast. Consequently, the Cu(OH)2/NiOOH nanofoam showed almost complete conversion of HMF to FDCA at 1.40 V vs RHE in 4 h with the best FE and yield for FDCA production of 98.3%, while the other nanofoam electrodes did not completely convert HMF to FDCA and required a sixfold longer reaction time to pass the equivalent charge amount for the full conversion to FDCA at 1.40 V vs RHE. The total carbon balance during the reaction was measured during the full conversion of HMF to FDCA. The final carbon balance of Cu(OH)2/NiOOH nanofoam reaches almost unity (99.9%) without losing the initial amount of substrates, which is even higher than that of Cu(OH)2/ NiOOH foam of 99.4%. The stability of Cu(OH)2/NiOOH nanofoam was also excellent; the consistent performance of <99% HMF conversion and <95% yield and FE for FDCA production were shown during the 5 repetitions of 5 mM HMF-to-FDCA conversion at 1.40 V vs RHE (Figure S24). The SEM (Figure S25), XRD (Figure S26), and XPS (Figure S27) analyses performed after the stability tests also support that the Cu(OH)2/NiOOH nanofoam electrode is stable without significant changes during the reaction. The FE and yield for FDCA production of Cu(OH)2/NiOOH nanofoam at 1.45 and 1.50 V vs RHE were poor compared to the other electrodes as the HMF and water oxidation reactions compete with each other (Table 1) because of early onset potential for water oxidation and the HMF oxidation (Figure S22d).

To evaluate the time-dependent HMF-to-FDCA conversion performance of electrodes, the HMF conversion and FDCA production rates were calculated with the results from foam electrodes at 1.50 V vs RHE and nanofoam electrodes at 1.40 V vs RHE, which are the best-performing potential for the foam and nanofoam electrodes, respectively. For both foam and nanofoam electrodes, the Cu(OH)2/NiOOH

exhibited the highest rate for the HMF conversion and FDCA production, demonstrating that decorating NiOOH on the Cu(OH)2 substrate is an effective strategy to boost the reactivity of NiOOH and Cu(OH)2 toward HMF-to-FDCA conversion (Table S1 and Figure 6). The Cu(OH)2/NiOOH foam electrodes showed a significant difference between the HMF conversion rate and the FDCA production rate, demonstrating that the FDCA production is significantly delayed due to the slower conversion speeds of intermediates to FDCA compared to the conversion speed of HMF to intermediates. Contrastively, the Cu(OH)2/NiOOH nanofoam showed very little difference between the HMF conversion rate and the FDCA production rate, demonstrating that the Cu(OH)2/NiOOH nanofoam has an excellent reactivity for intermediate oxidation as well as the HMF oxidation reaction, so that the converted HMF to intermediates can be quickly converted FDCA without delay.

To demonstrate the potential capability of Cu(OH)2/ NiOOH nanofoam for large-scale applications, the HMF-toFDCA conversion was performed with high-concentrated HMF solutions. The production of intermediates and FDCA was monitored for 60 C because the amount of OH− in the HMF solution over than 10 mM concentration was not enough for the full conversion to FDCA in the H-type cell used in this study. In the 10 and 20 mM HMF solutions, Cu(OH)2/ NiOOH nanofoam showed an excellent reactivity of the instantaneous conversion of HMF to FDCA with a negligible accumulation of intermediates (Figure S28). However, the result of 50 and 100 mM HMF solution showed that the considerable amount of intermediates are accumulated in the solution. We assume that this concentration-dependent performance decrease is not by the intrinsic catalytic reactivity of the Cu(OH)2/NiOOH nanofoam electrode, but by extrinsic factors because of the high HMF concentration compared to the OH− concentration and the H-type cell configuration, which can cause a decrease of electrolyte conductivity and a local shortage of hydroxyl anions at the electrode surface. To exclude these issues, the HMF-to-FDCA conversion with highconcentration HMF solutions was devised using a twoelectrode flow-reactor system (Figure 7a). Two-electrode

LSV curves of the HMF oxidation using Cu(OH)2/NiOOH nanofoam showed a gradual increase in current density and cathodic shift of onset potential as the HMF concentration increases to 50 mM (Figure 7b), proving that the flow-reactor system can provide a reaction environment better than the Htype cell (Figure S28e). The constant potential oxidation of different concentrations of HMF solution was performed using Cu(OH)2/NiOOH nanofoam at 1.9 V in the flow reactor. To prevent the decrease of oxidation current due to the depletion of hydroxyl anions, the pH of HMF solution was continuously adjusted to pH 13 by adding 5 M of NaOH solution. The result showed that the 97.7% yield and 96.7% FE for FDCA production were achieved with the 50 mM HMF condition (Figure 7c), which are almost identical to those obtained with the 5 mM HMF in the H-type cell (Table 1). The repetitive cycle tests of full conversion of 50 mM HMF to FDCA demonstrated that the initial reactivity of Cu(OH)2/NiOOH nanofoam was stably preserved (Figure 7d). After the full conversion reaction, the FDCA powders were collected from the electrolyte of the flow-reactor system by acid precipitation using H2SO4 solution to examine the purity of the FDCA. In the H NMR spectrum of the produced FDCA, only a strong peak at 7.2 ppm corresponding to ring protons was observed without any residues (Figure 7e). The HPLC spectrum also validated the >98.5% purity of FDCA without unreacted intermediates except for some unspecified polymeric substances (Figure 7f).

In conclusion, we demonstrated the different reactivities of NiOOH and Cu(OH)2 toward the electrochemical oxidation of alcohol and aldehyde on the furan ring and utilized their different characteristics synergistically to enhance the HMF-toFDCA conversion performance. The production rate of intermediate species during the conversion of HMF to FDCA and FAC to FCA using NiOOH and Cu(OH)2 suggested that they have different activities for alcohol to aldehyde and aldehyde to carboxylic acid oxidation reactions. The in situ XAS analysis demonstrated that the Cu(OH)2 surface is partially reduced when the aldehyde oxidation reaction is conducted as the electron transfer from Cu(OH)2 to the aldehyde group is much faster than the regeneration speed of Cu(OH)2 at the given applied potential. This characteristic was also observed for NiOOH (partial reduction of surface) but only for alcohol oxidation. This clearly indicates that the Cu(OH)2 surface has a high reactivity for the aldehyde to carboxylic acid oxidation, while NiOOH has a better reactivity than Cu(OH)2 for the alcohol to aldehyde oxidation. We also showed that the reactivity difference between NiOOH and Cu(OH)2 was significant when the alcohol and aldehyde oxidations are occurring competitively. Furthermore, between the two possible conversion pathways of HMF to FDCA, we assumed that the HMF was first converted to DFF by NiOOH and then sequentially conversed to FFCA and FDCA by the Cu(OH)2 at the NiOOH/Cu(OH)2 interface. Moreover, the NiOOH−Cu(OH)2 mixed electrodes showed a higher activity for HMF oxidation and a faster conversion to FDCA than individual NiOOH or Cu(OH)2 electrodes. Among the NiOOH−Cu(OH)2 mixed electrodes, the Cu(OH)2/ NiOOH structure, which has a high proportion of Cu(OH)2 at the surface, showed a better performance for FDCA production than the NiOOH/Cu(OH)2, as the aldehyde to carboxylic acid oxidation should be conducted twice as often as the alcohol to aldehyde oxidation in the HMF-to-FDCA conversion process. Additional performance enhancement was achieved using nanofoam electrodes comprising nanoscale pores and nanodendritic frames, which have on average 10 times higher ECSAs than commercial foams. The Cu(OH)2/ NiOOH nanofoam electrode showed an instantaneous conversion of HMF to FDCA without unreacted intermediates during the conversion process and the highest reactivity among all the compared electrodes. We expect our study to provide a strong basis for understanding a variety of electrochemical conversion reactions involving alcohol and aldehyde oxidation using NiOOH and Cu(OH)2 electrocatalysts.
